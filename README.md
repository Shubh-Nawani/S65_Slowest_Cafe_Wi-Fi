### **Project Title:**  
# List of the Slowest Internet Speeds by Coffee Shops  



### **Project Overview:**  
#### This project is a user-driven application where coffee shop patrons can log, view, and compare internet speeds at various coffee shops. The goal is to create a lighthearted yet functional platform that helps users avoid locations with frustratingly slow Wi-Fi while humorously highlighting the struggles of finding good internet in public spaces.  



### **Key Features:**  
1. **User Authentication:**  
   - Allow users to sign up and log in to submit and view data.  

2. **Coffee Shop Database:**  
   - Users can add coffee shop locations with details such as name, address, and average internet speed.  

3. **Speed Logging:**  
   - Submit internet speed test results for specific coffee shops using metrics like download/upload speed and latency.  

4. **Leaderboards:**  
   - Show rankings of coffee shops with the slowest internet speeds globally, locally, or per user.  

5. **Search and Filters:**  
   - Search coffee shops by name or location and filter results based on Wi-Fi performance.  

6. **Fun Stats:**  
   - Generate amusing insights like "This coffee shop has slower internet than 80% of others in the area!"  



### **Tech Stack:**  
#### Frontend:  
- **React** with **Vite** for building the UI.  
- **CSS** or **TailwindCSS** for styling.  

#### Backend:  
- **Node.js** with **Express.js** for server-side logic and APIs.  
- **MongoDB** (via **Mongoose**) for database management.  

#### Tools and Integrations:  
- **Speedtest API** (or a similar tool) to capture real-time internet speed data.  
- **Bruno** for API testing.  
- **Firebase Auth** (optional) for user authentication.  
- **Docker** (optional) for containerized deployment.  



### **Why This Project:**  
This project was chosen because it’s a humorous take on a common frustration—poor coffee shop internet speeds. The concept is engaging, unique, and allows for practical learning and implementation of essential full-stack development skills, including:  
1. API creation and deployment.  
2. Database schema design and integration with Mongoose.  
3. Frontend development with dynamic components for displaying user data.  
4. Secure user authentication and session management.
